# Salary Calculator

## Description

Duration: 2 Days

The goal was to allow the user to input data and then display that data in a table.
The table itself would be updated upon each entry and would allow the user to delete a specific employee.
Additionally, there is a running total of the monthly cost that is displayed on the bottom that will change to a blinking red if the monthly total is over 20,000

2. Employee + details will appear under the form in a table. Each row represents an employee.
3. The delete button in the rightmost column will delete the entire row from the table and the
   corresponding employee from the database.
4. If the monthly total is over 20,000 ( but not including ), the background of the total will flash
   yellow and red.
